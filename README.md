# Kaggle Project: Students-drop-out-prediction

## Dataset Description

The dataset is derived from a higher education institution, encompassing diverse undergraduate degrees such as agronomy, design, education, nursing, journalism, management, social service, and technologies. It combines information gathered from multiple disconnected databases. The dataset includes details available during student enrollment, including academic path, demographics, socioeconomic factors, and the students' academic performance at the end of the first and second semesters. The objective is to classify students into three categories: dropout, enrolled, and graduate, at the completion of the standard course duration. The classes are represented by the codes 0, 1, and 2 within the dataset. To preserve the integrity of the competition, all original column names have been anonymized. However, the essential information required for model development is provided below.
